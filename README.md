## Navigating this repository - Please Read!
* If given the option on GitHub, click "view code" to see my work. 
* See the "notes" folder for my notes. *.tex files are LaTeX, *.pdf are the compiled versions of such. If you'd like to edit and recompile TeX files, use your own distribution or an online compiler. 
* See the "projects" folder for projects. Upon opening the folder in GitHub, there should be a summary under the project files (the readme file). *.dwg are AutoCAD drawing files - ask me if you'd like to see them. Otherwise, *.pdf and *.png are visualizations of the project, including published AutoCAD documents. 
* Ignore "tmp" files - they exist so that Git doesn't collapse empty folders.
