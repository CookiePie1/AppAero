    \section{Reflections on my trip(s) to various cities}
    \subsection{Atlanta}
    \begin{outline}
        \1 Basic Information
            \2 \textbf{When} did I go?
                \3 11/4/2021
            \2 \textbf{Who} did I go with? Who did I meet/already know there?
                \3 Traveled alone, but met up with Emily Hang at GT. 
            \2 \textbf{Why} did I go? (What was the purpose of my trip?)
                \3 College visit for Georgia Tech. 
            \2 \textbf{What} did I do there?
                \3 Flew into ATL. Had breakfast at Sun In My Belly restaurant. Went on a campus tour at GT. Visited Centennial Olympic Park, National Center for Civil and Human Rights. Walked around GT with Emily, then went back to ATL. 
            \2 \textbf{Where} did I go, if it wasn't mentioned already?
                \3 I also kinda walked around some of the residential areas around GT, as well as near the restaurant in Oakhurst. 
                \3 Tried to go to the Delta Flight Museum but it was closed. 
        \1 Impressions
            \2 People: 
                \3 There were a lot of anti-maskers at GT, which was interesting. GT doesn't have a mask mandate because the University System of Georgia won't allow them to. 
                \3 People were pretty nice overall. How do I even judge the niceness of people?
            \2 Transit:
                \3 I mainly took the MARTA subway to places, and I didn't really use the bus. 
            \2 Climate:
                \3 The weather was really bad that day - it was cold and rainy for most of the morning, but that's apparently as bad as it gets in Georgia. 
            \2 Perceptions of the city's planning:
                \3 The thing I was really annoyed about is how there's a literal interstate that runs through the center of the city. Many cities have rivers that separate different geographical locations. Atlanta doesn't have that, but they somehow decided to do it artificially by building a damn highway right through the middle of the city?? Make it make sense. 

            \2 External POVs:
        \1 Other information 
            \2 Historical context:
                \3 Obviously, the South had a lot of segregation and the effects have inertia. 
            \2 Additional notes 
                \3 Whenever I visit a new city, if I have time, I like to try to go to the non-touristy areas to get a better sense of what the city is like. In Atlanta, I sort of achieved this by going to that breakfast restaurant that was not close to downtown at all. However, I could tell that I was in a probably more affluent neighborhood.
