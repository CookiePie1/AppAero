# Paper Airplane Lab

## Experimental Question

How does the size of a paper airplane affect the distance it flies?

## Hypothesis

Smaller airplanes will fly a farther distance because they have less drag on them. The typical paper airplane design does not really take advantage of lift except to prevent the airplane from falling prematurely - that is, they do not have a good glide distance. Therefore, smaller airplanes can be thrown like darts and fly farther. 

## Variables

Independent variable: airplane wingspan (cm)
Dependent variable: Flight distance (m)
Controlled variables: Paper type, throwing style, flight environment, same airplane for each wingspan trial

## Materials and Procedure

### Materials list
1. 6 sheets of paper (recycled letter 20 lb)
2. Scissors
3. Ruler
4. Pen/pencil
5. Measuring tape
6. Masking tape

### Procedure
1. Gather materials
2. Using the sheets of paper, make 7 paper airplanes, scaling down the side length of the shorter side by 1 inch each time. Mark the cuts with a ruler and pen, making sure to cut as straight as possible. Measure the largest wingspan after each airplane is constructed
    1. The paper airplane design is the typical one (diagram included). 
3. In a hallway, set the starting point with a strip of masking tape. 
4. For each airplane, do a few practice flights to get used to the flight characteristics of that size. Throw the airplane overhand with the amonut of force that maximizes the distance. 
5. For each airplane, conduct 5 recorded flights. Record the distance flown of each flight. 
6. Clean up work area
7. Analyze results
