# Urbanism Lecture

A lecture was given to my architecture class on Friday, March 11. The slides can be found in this folder. 

The presentation attempted to connect the topics of architecture, engineering, and environmental science under the broad concept of urbanism. Also included were references to social sciences, which of course play a role in cities as well. 

I referenced architectural design principles, engineering technologies and challenges, and environmental considerations that are pertinent to cities. I advocated for a future of urban living, for the sake of a more sustainable built environment, society, and state of human interaction.
