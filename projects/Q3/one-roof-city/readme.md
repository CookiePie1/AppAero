# Project 1: One Roof City

The goal: design a building/skyscraper with all the resources to sustain an entire community. 

Inspiration: Whittier, Alaska

Rules:
* You may have tunnels or other forms of connecting a few buildings but it should be as condensed as possible and one should be able to never leave the building if they so choose. 
* Fresh-air spaces are encouraged

## Brainstorming and Design Considerations
* Required services/resources
    * Hospital
    * Police
    * Fire supression/firefighting
    * School
    * College (?)
    * Open spaces/parks/greenspace
    * Transportation
        * Consider: airport people-movers, moving walkways
        * Elevators - express and local
    * Robust elevator systems
    * Different types of housing
        * Family - multiple bedrooms
        * Studio apartments
        * One and Two bedroom
        * Suites?
    * Utilities
        * Electricity - green generation
        * Heating - geothermal (probably)
        * Water
* Optional services/resources/features
    * Gallery/museum
* Design structure/overalls
    * Shape: build horizontally or vertically? - both
    * Area footprint
* Other Considerations
    * Environmental
    * Population/capacity
        * Potential for growth?
    * Emergency procedures
    * Security and public safety
    * Interactions/connections between residents

## Existing concepts
### Whittier, Alaska
* What makes Whittier a desireable place to live?
    * Residents cite the views, close and small community, isolation, and connection to nature. 
* In real life, what necessitates that Whittier should have most of its resources under one roof?
    * Mostly because the weather is so bad there and the winds are so high during the winter. 
* How do residents enjoy life in Whittier?
    * Most people who stay in Whittier have a reason to do so. Relates to the first question above. 

### Cruise Ships
* Usually have all the utilities and operations stuff on the very low decks; interior cabins on the lower decks; then cabins with balconies as well as entertainment venues; on the upper decks are bars, restaurants, pool, etc. 
* Has emergency services/everything needed to survive for a relatively short period of time but really can't sustain for longer periods of time without going to port.

### "Interior Urbanism"
* Arises from the planned or organic growth of vast indoor spaces, such as the Chicago Pedway or large entertainment venues in Las Vegas. Cruise ships are an example of this too. 

## Design Log
1. Level/area planning - v1
    1. Main lobby:
        1. Common gathering space; can be used for events; visitor services
        2. Security screening area
    2. Basement: entertainment area: club/bar; utilities
    3. Floor 1 - main lobby and gathering space
    4. Floors 2-3: ballrooms, more large event space; auditorium
    5. Floors 1-4, building 2: medical center, public safety main office
2. Area planning: thinking bigger
    1. It might be better and make more sense to have things somewhat separated into zones. 
    2. Consider having multiple mixed-use buildings, and others that focus on things like education, healthcare/safety, business ops, etc. 
    3. Have an automated people-mover connecting buildings
    4. Outdoor park space if the outdoors are not constrained due to weather or climate

## What are the challenges associated with Interior Urbanism?
* Mainly, that people often get lost inside large, poorly planned indoor spaces that often grow organically rather than in a designed fashion
* Lack of access to fresh air or the outside world in general. Consider the greek myth about the Lotus flowers: the people were stuck on the island and forgot about anything else that happened outside of their shrunken world. 
* Overall, building entire cities on the scale of a few buildings is usually impractical and not a good idea. Particularly, you limit the growth capacity of your "city" and it is usually not necessary or right to confine people to a building for an extended period of time.
