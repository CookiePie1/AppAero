# PPL Test Prep Summary

### Purpose

To learn the basics of knowledge required to pass the FAA Private Pilot-Airplane knowledge test; to consider the aerodynamic/aerial navigational principles reflected in the topics. 

## Methods

I used the Gleim PPL book to study. For each of the listed study units, I took notes on the content. Then, I completed each of the questions for each unit, first without looking at the answer explanations. Then, for the questions I got wrong, I wrote down the correct answer and why it was correct/why the chosen answer was wrong. Then, I began taking full practice tests after I had gone through most of the study units. 

## Results

The section scores are listed in the "topics" document. Notes documents, as well as quiz missed questions are in each unit's document. I am able to pass online practice tests with an accuracy of 90% or greater consistently.
