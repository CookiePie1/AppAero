# City Map Project [Work in Progress]

The aim of this project is to apply principles of urban planning and transportation planning to create my own "ideal city". 

Progress screenshots: 

Overall city view, showing major streets. There is a grid system, where there is a major street every mile, running E/W and N/S. There are also radial major streets that allow easier diagonal travel. Exception to this rule: There are two major streets running directly N/S and E/W of the city's geographical center, which is a half-mile away from the nearest parallel major streets.

City center view, showing some minor streets. The grid system's numbering is shown as well. Each minor block has 100 possible address numbers, with 800 numbers in a mile (each minor block is 1/8 mile). At the center of the city is a common park/gathering spot. The central circle is a large plaza, and the inner square is an elevated platform. Dashed lines indicate walking paths, and the minor circles scattered around the central square are meant to be smaller gathering spots.

Work in progress: The city map will include street and place names, land use zoning, public transit, additional parks, universities, etc.
