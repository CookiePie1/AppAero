# Q1 Project Brainstormsing 

* Design a utopia based on a few guiding principles of choice
    * Guiding principles for an ideal city:
        * Transit should be accessible and plentiful - anyone should be able to get from any point to another within the city in a reasonable amount of time
        * Different sectors/land uses should be sectioned strategically based on their transportation costs. 
        * The city should be safe for people regardless of minority status and/or gender - how can this be designed?
        * Public greenspaces and parks should be readily available. 
    * Should it be in a radial circle? Grid?
    * [Questions to consider](http://www.seesharppress.com/utopia.html)
