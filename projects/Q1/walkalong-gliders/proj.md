# Project: Walkalong Gliders

Walkalong gliders are light airplanes that are assisted in sustained flight by a person walking behind it with a paddle/surface that helps it along using the ridge effect. See notebook for illustrations and diagrams. 

Why does the tumblewing tumble? The center of gravity and center of lift are not in the same location along the wing; the difference creates a rotational moment and the airfoil flips over. Once it's right-side up again, the same effect takes place and it continues "tumbling" in this manner. 

Ridge effect - the air is deflected by the plane and the area with the highest speed is the area just above the top edge of the plane.
