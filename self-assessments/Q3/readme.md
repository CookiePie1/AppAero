# Q3 Self Assessment

1. Concepts I know well
    1. Ways that cities relate to the environment
    2. Civil engineering and environmental science applications of urbanism and city planning
    3. Public works infrastructure (water treatment and waste management)
    4. Experimental design components

2. Concepts I don't know well
    1. Drawing/sketching skills
    2. Implementing larger building projects in Revit
    3. How to build a good paper airplane
3. Materials and resources
    1. Internet research on architecture, urbanism, and interior urbanism
    2. Google maps data of cities
    3. Background information
    4. Youtube videos by urbanists/researchers/transit enthusiasts
4. Grades:
    1. Quantity of work done: A
        1. I did three projects this quarter, as compared to two projects each during 1st quarter and 2nd quarter. Even though these projects were slightly smaller, the amount of work done was comparable. My work this quarter more focused on applying what I have learned in this course throughout the year and connecting it with other content and information as opposed to taking new notes or covering new topics. 
    2. Quality of work done: A-
        1. I intended on CADing out the first project, either in Revit or in AutoCAD. However, I quickly realized that it would take way too long and it would be a waste of time since the tasks are tedious and not really design-oriented. As a result, I uploaded the sketches I made that convey my ideas but in a less aesthetically pleasing manner. While this decreases the quality of work, the ideas are still there. I believe that the presentation I made was very high-quality, and I am proud of the slides that I designed and delivered. For the paper airplane lab, the data I collected was not very good. The flights were very inconsistent. However, I did address these concerns in the discussion. 
    3. Effort: A-
        1. I feel that my effort was slightly lacking towards the beginning of the quarter, since I made less progress during each class period than I did in the previous two quarters. However, I did increase my effort towards the end of this quarter. My effort was not bad by any means, but it could have been better. 
    4. Understanding: A
        1. In making my presentation, I got a really good understanding of cities as a whole, and it was actually really interesting to me the amount of cross-disciplinary applications there are. For example, considering why people live in cities has to do with social science and anthropology; thinking about city infrastructure has numerous civil engineering applications; the form of cities is heavily architectural, and of course, we can apply environmental science to analyze how cities impact the environment and how they can become more sustainable. I loved how applicable these concepts are to my major in college, and it gives me a lot of excitement and hope to be able to make an positive impact on people's lives through infrastructure and engineering. As far as aerodynamics, the lab I did had pretty bad results, but I can understand and identify the factors that made the results bad (thus, understanding). If I had the opportunity to use better materials, perform the lab again in a more controlled environment, and rethink my experimental design, the results would have improved. 
5. The grade I wish to have: A
    1. I would like to have an A to maintain my course average as we continue throughout the year. I also want a comfortable safety margin for Q4. 
6. The grade I deserve: A
    1. I deserve an A because I have done my work throughout this quarter, and have the results to show for it. I am satisfied with the work I have done this quarter. 
7. The grade Cakir would give me: A
    1. I think Dr. Cakir would give me an A based on this self assessment and the work submitted.
