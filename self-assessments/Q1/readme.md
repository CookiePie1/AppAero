# Quarter 1 Self Assessment
1. Concepts I know well. 
    1. Aerodynamics
        - Basics
            - Four fundamental forces of flight, mechanics concepts such as conservation of mass, energy, momentum; airfoil basics, what turbulence is, etc. These are all basic extensions of physics. 
        - Tumblewing gliders
            - Combining my understanding of Newtonian dynamics and how airfoils produce lift, the problem of the Tumblewing becomes easily understandable through rotational dynamics (ask me to draw a diagram). These findings are confirmed through physical observation of a glider. 
        - Ridge effect
            - Based on my understanding of Bernoulli's equation as conservation of energy in fluids, it makes sense that an obstacle such as a plane in moving air deflects the flow in the way it does. 
    2. Transportation
        - The ways in which transportation benefits communities, and the ways that lack of transportation harms communities. 
        - Case studies of how certain transportation systems work (at a high level), particularly Chicago and NJT. 
        - The importance of well-planned transportation: transportation is one of the highest living costs in any given area, and most of our activities/ways of living would not be possible at all without good and accessible transportation. 
    3. Urbanism
        - Why suburbs are bad.
        - Demographics of American cities. 
        - Car-centric infrastructure, and how it has adversely affected our communities. 
        - Land use: zoning regulations are absolutely necessary to geographically separate different land uses within the city, lest our cities end up like Houston where no zoning laws exist. There are different frameworks to where exactly different buildings/areas should go, but they do follow principles such as transportation cost. 
2. Concepts I don't know well. 
    1. Aerodynamics
        - Flying wing gliders - how do they fly without a stabilizing surface?
        - Mathematics of aerodynamics. 
    2. Transportation
        - How do we choose where to put transit stations? How can we make sure certain communities are not disadvantaged? How can we undo past damages to communities? For example, my sense of scale was definitely off for the Central Jersey transit project. 
    3. Urbanism
        - Cognitive biases and how they relate to urban planning/transportation. I took notes on this, but I'm having trouble drawing a good connection to how we might use/consider them when planning transportation and cities. 
        - What might we take and leave from 19th and 20th century urban planning visionaries? Which concepts are practical, and which ones aren't?
        - I would love to examine more closely the ideas of particularly well known players of Urbanism, such as Robert Moses, Jane Jacobs, Le Corbusier, etc. 
3. Books and resources this quarter. 
    - Transportation design: MIT 11.550x
    - Various print and internet resources, which are linked in the notes documents. [If using the GitHub pdf preview, hyperlinks are not clickable. Please see the tex file or open the pdf in a new window.]
4. Grades:
    1. Quantity of work done: B+
        - Of course, I could have done more work with this course - there's always more work to do. Because I didn't follow a specific, singular textbook, nor does my course follow Dr. Cakir's traditional courses, I have less of a benchmark to compare myself to. However, I did work consistently throughout the quarter, and I am mostly satisfied with what I have accomplished in this time period, especially consider the other things going on in life (notably, College Apps). I would have wanted to get more of the third project done. 
    2. Quality of work done: A-
        - Some of the notes could be more detailed (like section 4, and section 5 is a running doc that doesn't look very pretty). However, I am satisfied with the depth and breadth of the other notes sections. Additionally, I am quite proud of the Central Jersey transit project, and how the Ideal City Map project is coming along. The documentation for the CNJ project is detailed. I would like for my documentation of the Walkalong Gliders project to be more neat and detailed, but I am capable of explaining in words and/or drawings upon request. 
    3. Effort: A-
        - I have consistently worked on this project throughout the quarter, and I have held myself accountable with a progress tracker document. I have taken this course seriously, and even though I changed my initial plans significantly, I have still put a good amount of effort into this course. I am not getting an A in this section because I definitely still could have spent more time on this. 
    4. Understanding: A-
        - I feel as though I have a good grasp of bigger ideas pertaining to each broad topic of the course. Though I haven't used tests as a part of my learning, I am showing my application of the knowledge through my projects, and reflecting on how I could better apply the concepts. I hope the work I have completed is a good reflection of the degree to which I understand the material. 
5. The grade I wish to have: A. 
    1. Superficial reasons: I don't want to Asian-fail, it will drop my GPA because the course is unweighted, etc. Mostly, I would just be mildly embarassed because I can't even get an A in the course I literally designed. 
    2. Better reasons: I am truly interested in the content I'm covering, and I realize that this work has important applications in my career and to greater society. While there is always room for improvement, I am overall satisfied with what I have completed this quarter. 
6. The grade I deserve based on item 4. 
    1. I deserve an A- based on what I have presented in part 4. 
7. What grade I think Dr. Cakir would give me based on my understanding. 
    1. I think Dr. Cakir would give me an A- based on the evidence and reasoning I have presented here and in this entire repository. 
8. [Additional] - What I would like to do moving forward. 
    1. Complete the city-map project, but read more into famous urban planners in history and see what they would have done. 
    2. Reflect on my recent trip to Atlanta, Baltimore, and DC and write these down. Think further back to Chicago and Cleveland, and even further back to Chinese Cities. 
9. [Additional] - Broad realizations and takeaways. 
    1. Transportation can make or break communities. 
    2. Transportation is expensive. 
    3. While cities are people-centered, they also rely on a lot of technology. 
    4. Cities should be designed for people, not cars. 
    5. Aerodynamics is much more complicated than I ever imagined. Even small changes or unexpected factors can throw everything off.
