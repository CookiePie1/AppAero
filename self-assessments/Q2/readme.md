# Quarter 2 Self Assessment
1. Concepts I know well
    * Urban Planning: Principles of smart urban growth and design (environmental perspectives); why mixed-use land development is desireable; urban housing in the present, and possible future solutions. CAD techniques for drafting/drawing. 
    * Aerodynamics: airplanes and flight; aircraft systems; airports and ATC; Federal Aviation Regulations pursuant to PPLs; performance, weight, and balance; ADM and aeromedical factors; aviation weather services; XC flight planning
2. Concepts I don't know well
    * Urban Planning: specific geographical/topological impacts on zoning/land use; approaches to homelessness in major US urban areas. 
    * Aerodynamics: airspace; VORs; flight maneuvers; aviation weather phenomena
3. Resources
    * Urban: web research; zoning maps of NYC and Chicago. 
    * Aerodynamics: Gleim Aviation - Private Pilot Knowledge Test Prep 2022 Edition
4. Grading
    1. Quantity of work
        * In the urbanism section, even though I only completed one project, it was a major undertaking and took a lot of time to plan, think through, and express through CAD. In addition, I covered a lot of content during the aerodynamics section (by the time the quarter ends, I will have completed the entire curriculum). 
    2. Quality of work
        * I'm proud of the project I've created, and I feel that the time I spent on it was not wasted. The result was considerably detailed given the theoretical nature of the project. As far as the aerodynamics portion, my notes were taken for the sake of studying, not presentation. Nevertheless, I still got the information I needed, and the missed questions section is detailed. 
    3. Effort
        * My progress was a little sluggish toward the beginning of the quarter because of college apps, but as things transitioned, I began to make more progress. During winter break and our virtual period, I was extremely productive as far as the aerodynamics topic and covered most of the content. 
    4. Understanding
        * Urban Planning: Looking at the current plans of New York and Chicago, as well as examining proposed plans and "ideal city" plans, I can get a sense of why decisions were made the way they were. The most interesting part of this to me is that the reasons aren't always good: in the US, every major city's plan was informed partly by racism and segregation. Worldwide, income and wealth inequality plays a major role in city planning as well. Overall, my understanding of traditional city planning is reflected in the design decisions in my project. My understanding is limited in the sense that I was not able to take geographical information/existing infrastructure into account in my project. 
        * Aerodynamics: My understanding of the material is quite solid; I consistently score 95% or higher on practice tests. The only downfall with the PAR knowledge test is that it doesn't all information necessary to be a proficient pilot. 
5. The grade I wish to have: A
    * I would like an A because I feel like what I have done so far deserves it. My understanding and interest in the topics has only increased, and I am constantly considering ways that I can apply my knowledge in the world around me. Also, it would bring up my 92 to an A. 
6. The grade I deserve: A
    * I feel that the work I have done cumulatively has amounted to an A, both in amount and quality. I have been continuously building on the principles I have learned, especially in the Urban Planning topics. I have a very good grasp of the topics, to the point where I could have a productive conversation with someone about why our cities are struggling and what we can do to make them better. 
7. The grade Dr. Cakir would assign me: A
    * Dr. Cakir would give me an A because he trusts the quality of my work and the honesty of my self assessment. Although I have not followed my course plan exactly, I have been productive and I am personally proud of my work.
